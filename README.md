    Test the software.
        There are so many different cell phones out there, that it's impossible for me to test AndAR on all of them. Please test it on your phone and report any bugs. :D
        I'm only able to test AndAR on: Nexus One (2.1) and a T-Mobile G1 (1.5, 1.6) 
    Write code
        Any code contributions are welcome :D
        Want access to the repository? Send me a email and I will give you access, in the hope you are not doing anything evil ;)
        I hope I will find some time soon, to write some development howtos.
